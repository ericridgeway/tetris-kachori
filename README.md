# Phrenzy Instructions

Fork this repo and start build an application! See [Phoenix Phrenzy](https://phoenixphrenzy.com) for details.

Note: for development, you'll need Elixir, Erlang and Node.js. If you use the [asdf version manager](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) and install the [relevant plugins](https://asdf-vm.com/#/plugins-all?id=plugin-list), you can install the versions specified in `.tool-versions` with `asdf install`.


## Deployment

How you deploy your app is up to you. A couple of the easiest options are:

- Heroku ([instructions](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/heroku.html))
- [Gigalixir](https://gigalixir.com/) (doesn't limit number of connections)

## The Usual README Content

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
